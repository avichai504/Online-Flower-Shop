# Technical Requirements for the Project

## System Infrastructure

- Server-side: Node.JS using Express.
- Client-side: React.

## Data Storage and Retrieval

- Data storage and retrieval will be done using MongoDB.

## System Models

- The system will support at least 3 different models, for example:
  - Model for displaying items.
  - Model for user login and password.
  - Model for shopping cart.

## Model Operations

- The system must support the following operations for each model:

  - Create: Creating a new object.
  - Update: Updating the content of an object (e.g., updating product details).
  - Delete: Deleting an object (e.g., deleting a product).
  - List: Listing objects (e.g., list of products).
  - Search: Searching for objects based on various categories (e.g., finding products by a specific price).

  The application must allow the user to perform all these operations on each model.

## Search Queries

- The system will support at least 2 search queries that allow the user to define at least 3 parameters for searching through the user interface (e.g., searching for a TV by screen size, resolution, and manufacturer).

## Error Handling and Validation

- The system must handle edge cases, errors, and validations both on the server-side and client-side, ensuring the server does not crash even when receiving unexpected or abnormal input from the user.

## React Capabilities

- The system will support the following React capabilities:
  - Video
  - Canvas

## CSS3 Capabilities

- The system will support the following CSS3 capabilities:
  - Text-shadow
  - Transition
  - Multiple-columns
  - Font-face
  - Border-radius

## Statistical Data Presentation

- The system will display statistical data in at least 2 graphs (e.g., average number of posts per group per month) using the D3.JS package. The data displayed will come from the database and present dynamic information based on the current data in the database.
